## My process

### Built with

- React
- Tailwind
- Framer-motion


### What I learned

This project was pleasant to learn more about framer-motion, which I found really amazing. I love adding a lot of motion to this project.
It was also the first time I used tailwind, and I'm blown away by the simplicity of the framework. I only used CSS to style the checkbox as it seemed to be more efficient, but I could have use tailwind as well. I also change the background to something a bit more personal.

### Continued development

I would love to add a pan option like in iOS to delete items from the list. It would be possible with framer-motion, and it would be nice to take some time to look at it.
